* Idea from [Asher Wolf](https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf)
* List of candidates from [smidgey](https://twitter.com/smidgey) which in turn
came from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_Australian_federal_election,_2016)

## Installation

Assumptions:

* You have a python install (2.7ish)
* You have a virtual env running and pip ready to go

```
git clone https://github.com/ajfisher/wikicandidate
pip install requirements.txt

You can pass [reps | senate] to the python command to just get one set of data

Data will spit out onto your console.
